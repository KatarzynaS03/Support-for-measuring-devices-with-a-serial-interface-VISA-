# Support-for-measuring-devices-with-a-serial-interface-VISA-
Getting to know the methods of operating devices equipped with a serial interface. For the implementation of the project, a multimeter with a serial interface compliant with the RS232 standard will be used. The project converted the measurements of resistance to temperature conversion for PT100 and KTY81-210
